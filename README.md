Overview :
This plugin allows you to forbid users from posting in specific forums if they don't post in other sections.

Options :
- Sections which are concerned by the system
- Maximum messages that can be posted in a row, in those sections
- Needed posts count in other sections to unset the antiflood
- Notification text

Note :
FID = Forum ID
You can get it by hovering the link of the specific section, you get for example : forumdisplay.php?fid=5
Means the FID is 5

Will be on MyBB Mods soon !
